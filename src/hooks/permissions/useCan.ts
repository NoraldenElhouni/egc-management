// =====================================================================
// PHASE 7B — the desktop app's one gating hook
// =====================================================================
// Everything else in src/hooks/permissions/ is admin-screen plumbing:
// read-only, display-only, and it takes a user id because it exists to
// show you someone ELSE's permissions. This file is the opposite. It
// answers "what may *I* do", it drives real UI, and no caller can ask
// on another person's behalf — my_effective_permissions() reads
// auth.uid() itself and ignores anything we might pass.
//
// ONE CALL, NOT N. Batches 4 and 5 gate dozens of menu items on the
// same page. useCan() does not fetch; it reads the single cached answer
// that useMyPermissions() holds, so twenty gated items on one screen
// still cost one round trip. React Query dedupes concurrent callers of
// the same key, so this holds even on first paint.
//
// DENY WHILE LOADING, DENY ON ERROR. A permission that has not been
// resolved yet is not a grant, and neither is a failed request. Callers
// that would flash a "you cannot do this" message should read `loading`
// and render a neutral state instead of the denial — see EmployeeRole.
//
// PROJECT SCOPE. Pass a projectId for project-scoped permissions.
// Without one the resolver returns allowed = false with source_layer
// 'no_project_context' for every project-scoped permission
// (phase2-resolver.sql, DECISION 3). That is correct, but it means a
// project permission asked company-wide always denies. Check
// permission_catalog.is_project_scoped if you are unsure which you have.
// =====================================================================

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// ISSUE 13 — the cache must be keyed by WHO IS ASKING
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// The first version of this file cached under ["my-effective-permissions",
// projectId]. The answer depends entirely on auth.uid(), and the key did
// not mention it. Two bugs came out of that one omission.
//
// TOO LITTLE. On a cold start the query could fire before the Supabase
// session had attached. auth.uid() was null, the resolver denied
// everything — correctly — and that empty set was then cached as the
// answer for thirty seconds. The user saw an app with no menu and no
// error. This is what made a Head Finance account that resolves five
// permissions in the database look like it had none.
//
// TOO MUCH, which is the serious half. Log out, log in as somebody else
// in the same window, and the new user reads the previous user's cached
// set. Menus render from it and route guards let them through. An
// access-control answer for one person was being served to another.
//
// Both are fixed here by the same three changes:
//
//   1. The auth user id is part of the query key, so two people can
//      never collide on one cache entry.
//   2. `enabled` holds the query until a session exists, so we never
//      cache an answer computed for auth.uid() = null.
//   3. "No session yet" reports as LOADING, not as denied. Callers
//      already render neutral while loading, so nothing flashes.
//
// The fourth change lives elsewhere: AuthProvider clears the whole query
// cache when the signed-in user changes. Keying alone would be enough
// for this hook, but every other cached query — employees, projects,
// payroll — has the same exposure and none of them are keyed by user
// either.

/**
 * The id of the account whose session the Supabase client is actually

 *
 * These are usually the same, and when they are not it is precisely the
 * moment this matters: AuthProvider restores a UserData from local
 * storage synchronously on boot, while the Supabase session is read
 * from disk and refreshed asynchronously. During that window the local
 * user exists and auth.uid() does not, so a permission answer keyed on
 * the local user would be filed under the right name with the wrong
 * contents.
 *
 * `resolved` is false only until the first answer arrives — after that
 * a null userId genuinely means signed out.
